Conway's Game of Life - Semester Project on Computer Simulations (PJATK)

4th semester

This project represents conways game of life.
I used .NET WPF in creation of this project.

This how the game window looks like.

You can: 
change cells state,
clear the game field, 
randomise game field,
change game rules,
change field width (field height also changes, to make cells more like squares),
pause the game,
resume the game.

The game field is not infinite, but has no boundaries. Every object that comes to the edge of the screen appears on the other side.

This project can be used to simulate a behaviour of various determo-chaotic phenomenas.
